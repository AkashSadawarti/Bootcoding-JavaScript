//Basic Operations by User Input
const p = prompt('Enter the First Number')
const q = prompt('Enter the Second Number')
// `${}` can be used to enter user value it changes dynamically according to user

console.log('Multiplication of two Numbers is ' + (p*q))
console.log('Division of two Numbers is ' + (p/q))
console.log('Number P is less than Q = ' + (p<q))
console.log('Number Q is greater than P = ' + (q>p))
console.log('Number P is greater than Q = ' + (p>q))
